# Commands & Permissions

The three main commands for Quests are **/quests**, **/quest**, and **/questadmin**. The first two are enabled for all users by default, while the last one is reserved for server ops. To change this behavior, such as giving **/questadmin** to non-op administrators, you must set up [permissions](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Understanding\_Permissions).

### Player Commands

Below is a chart which describes each command and its associated permission. Note that the subcommands (list, take, quit, et al.) can change if you [select another plugin language](https://github.com/PikaMug/Quests/wiki/Translations), but permissions will remain the same.

# Bridge Plugins

Plenty of other server plugins natively depend on Quests. However, it is sometimes easier or more beneficial for a developer to make an "in-between" plugin to link their resource to Quests. Unlike [modules](https://github.com/PikaMug/Quests/wiki/Casual-%E2%80%90-Modules), bridge plugins handle more than just objectives or rewards. Below is a list of published examples.
